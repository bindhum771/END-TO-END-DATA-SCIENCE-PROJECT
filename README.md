 ðŸŒ¼ Full Data Science Project with Flask

# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction Project

End-to-end data science project from data collection to deployment.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents
- notebooks/: Data exploration, preprocessing & model training
- app/: Flask app to deploy model
- model/: Saved model
- requirements.txt

âœ¨ Features (Short)
âœ… Train a churn prediction model on sample data
âœ… Predict customer churn based on tenure, monthly charges & total charges
âœ… Simple Flask web app with form input
âœ… Shows result: Yes / No with churn probability (e.g., 72.3%)
âœ… Clear project structure & ready to extend with real data

## ðŸš€ How to run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Go to `app` folder: `cd app`
3. Run app: `python app.py`

ðŸŒ± **Future Improvements**
Replace sample data with a real churn dataset (e.g., from Kaggle)
Try advanced models (XGBoost, Logistic Regression) & tune hyperparameters
Improve web UI with Bootstrap & add visual probability bars
Add explainability (SHAP/LIME) to show why customers may churn
Deploy the app to cloud (Heroku, Render) for public access
